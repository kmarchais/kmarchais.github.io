Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS) are fascinating mathematical structures that repeat infinitely in three dimensions. They have zero mean curvature everywhere, making them minimal surfaces.

## The Gyroid Equation

The most famous TPMS is the **Gyroid**, discovered by Alan Schoen in 1970. Its implicit equation is:

$$
\sin(x)\cos(y) + \sin(y)\cos(z) + \sin(z)\cos(x) = 0
$$

This elegant formula produces a surface that divides space into two intertwined, congruent labyrinths.

## Implementation in Python

Here's how you might evaluate the gyroid function:

```python
import numpy as np

def gyroid(x, y, z, frequency=1.0):
    """Evaluate the gyroid implicit surface."""
    x, y, z = x * frequency, y * frequency, z * frequency
    return (
        np.sin(x) * np.cos(y) +
        np.sin(y) * np.cos(z) +
        np.sin(z) * np.cos(x)
    )
```

## Ray Marching for Visualization

To render TPMS in real-time, we use **ray marching** - a technique that steps along rays from the camera and evaluates the implicit function at each point.

The basic algorithm:

1. Cast a ray from camera through each pixel
2. Step along the ray in small increments
3. Evaluate the TPMS function at each point
4. When the sign changes, we've crossed the surface
5. Refine the intersection point and compute normals

## Applications

TPMS have numerous practical applications:

- **Additive manufacturing** - Lightweight structures with high strength-to-weight ratios
- **Tissue engineering** - Scaffolds for cell growth
- **Heat exchangers** - Maximizing surface area for heat transfer
- **Acoustic materials** - Sound absorption and diffusion
